# Company ITSM Incident Ticket Management Machine Learning Project

This project revolves around leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze and extract insights from the Company ITSM (Information Technology Service Management) incident ticket data. With a dataset comprising 25 columns and 466606 rows of ticket information, the project aims to address several critical objectives:

1. **Predicting High Priority Tickets:** The primary focus is on predicting priority 1 & 2 tickets. By accurately identifying these high-priority tickets, the organization can proactively address issues, implement preventive measures, or allocate resources efficiently to resolve the problems before they escalate.

2. **Forecasting Incident Volume:** Another significant aspect involves forecasting the volume of incidents across different fields on both quarterly and annual scales. These forecasts play a crucial role in resource planning, allowing the organization to anticipate demand, allocate personnel, and deploy technology effectively to handle incoming incidents.

3. **Auto Tagging Tickets:** Automating the process of tagging tickets with the appropriate priorities and departments can significantly streamline the incident management workflow. By utilizing machine learning models, the project aims to reduce manual efforts, minimize reassigning delays, and ensure that tickets are promptly routed to the relevant departments for resolution.

4. **Predicting RFC and Possible Failure/Misconfiguration:** Request for Change (RFC) occurrences and potential failures or misconfigurations in ITSM assets are vital aspects of IT infrastructure management. By predicting RFC events and identifying potential failures or misconfigurations, the organization can proactively implement changes, perform maintenance, or address issues to maintain the reliability and stability of IT systems.

## Tasks Performed

### Task 1: Predicting High Priority Tickets
For this task, various machine learning algorithms were employed, focusing on classification techniques tailored to prioritize high-priority tickets accurately. By analyzing historical ticket data and identifying patterns associated with priority levels, the models aim to predict priority 1 & 2 tickets with high accuracy.

### Task 2: Forecasting Incident Volume
Time series analysis techniques were utilized to forecast incident volume across different fields, providing quarterly and annual forecasts. By considering historical trends and seasonal patterns in incident data, the models generate forecasts to aid in resource allocation, capacity planning, and technology provisioning.

### Task 3: Auto Tagging Tickets
Machine learning models were developed to automate the tagging process for incident tickets, assigning appropriate priorities and departments based on ticket attributes. By learning from past ticket data and user interactions, the models streamline ticket management workflows, reducing manual effort and improving response times.

### Task 4: Predicting RFC and Possible Failure/Misconfiguration
Machine learning algorithms were applied to predict RFC occurrences and identify potential failure or misconfiguration scenarios in ITSM assets. By analyzing historical data, system configurations, and maintenance logs, the models aim to proactively detect issues, minimize downtime, and optimize IT infrastructure performance.

## Conclusion
In summary, the machine learning models developed as part of this project have demonstrated strong performance across various tasks related to Company ITSM incident ticket management. Particularly noteworthy is the exceptional accuracy achieved in predicting RFC occurrences and possible failure/misconfiguration scenarios, with an accuracy score of 98%. These insights empower the organization to adopt proactive strategies, enhance operational efficiency, and ensure the reliability and resilience of IT systems. By leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques, the project contributes to optimizing ITSM processes, driving continuous improvement, and delivering value to the organization.
